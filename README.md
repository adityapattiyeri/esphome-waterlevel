Measure the following:
MAX --> Distance from sensor to the max water level in CM.
MIN --> Distance from sensor to min water level in CM.

Calculate M:
M= 100/(MIN-MAX)

Expression:
M(MIN - (X*100))



Example:
Say MAX is 10cm and MIN is 120cm

M= 100/(120-10) = 0.9

So the expression will be:
0.9(120- (X*100))
